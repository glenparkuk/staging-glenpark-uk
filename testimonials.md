        <p class="light-italic">I came to Glen with a limp, a very painful hip and was despairing of finding relief. Her expertise and extensive knowledge of the Alexander Technique, combined with her unique hands-on healing, which works on the physical and on the emotional aspects of my condition has had a remarkable healing effect.
            <br /> I am now able to walk freely, go dancing, gardening, and enjoy all the activities I&#39;d feared I&#39;d never be able to do again. I have practical tools to keep me &ldquo;on track&rdquo; and a deeper knowledge and understanding of how to tune in to what my body needs. Glen has an incredible sensitivity and an immensely supportive and empowering approach to healing.

        <p class="light-italic">I have worked with Glen for almost 6 years and her work has profoundly supported me both in my personal growth and professional development as an Alexander Technique teacher.
            <br /> She has great sensitivity, generosity of heart and her work is founded on a deep understanding of the relationship between the psychophysical and the spiritual. She practices the Art of Changing with enormous integrity and I thoroughly recommend her to anyone wishing to make conscious changes in their lives.

        <p class="light-italic">Glen&#39;s touch is subtle, often hardly perceptible, but the effects are deep and profound. She has touched deep trauma in my body and integrated it in a way that talking therapy never managed to do. My body feels much more receptive and alive. I can feel what is going on at a much deeper level. Thanks to her work, I am becoming more conscious and more present.

        <p class="light-italic">I found Glen&#39;s approach wonderfully holistic: expert and gifted Alexander &lsquo;hands&rsquo;, exciting &#40;and new to me&#41; work with chakras and a down-to-earth and compassionate approach to addressing growth through suggestions in discussion and exercises.  I learnt a lot in a short time and felt a significant &lsquo;shift&rsquo;.  I&#39;m very glad I made it to Devon to see her.
